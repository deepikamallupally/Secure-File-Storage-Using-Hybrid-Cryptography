Next Steps
To integrate cloud storage, follow the steps outlined previously to modify your app.py, encrypter.py, and decrypter.py to handle AWS S3 operations.

Set Up AWS S3 Bucket: Create a bucket on AWS S3 for storing your encrypted files.

Install Boto3: Make sure Boto3 is installed for interacting with AWS S3.

Update Encryption Process: Upload encrypted files to S3 after encryption.

Update Decryption Process: Download encrypted files from S3 before decryption.
